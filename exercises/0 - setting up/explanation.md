Angular training
================================================================

**Goal**:
- Quickly set up an angular app with which you can browse through a list of movies, see movie details and edit these details
- The application must be build with reusable components and have a structure that abides by the de angular best practices.

**Assignment structure**:
- Each assignment has its own folder in the exercises folder
- An assignment folder contains:
  - An `assignment.md` file where the assigment itself is described.
  - Sometimes an `explanation.md` file that gives further explanation if needed.
  - Sometimes other files to support the assignment.

An assignment consist of a title, a description in one or two sentences, resource links, steps, sometimes 'extra' steps and a result.
- Advanced 'students' can try to perform the assignment by using only the description and links in stead of following the steps.
- Extra steps are not explained, just a description is given

The assignments are grouped into subjects. each subject will be live coded and explained before the students start doing the assignments.
After a subject, questions can be asked. If a student is done with a subject, he may help other students where possible. subjects:

- Subject 1: creating stateful/stateless components and the component tree
- Subject 2: creating a (feature) module and bundling funtionality 
- Subject 3: retreiving data with a service and observables
- Subject 4: processing user input with a form
- Subject 5: routing and navigation between views
- Subject 6: styling and shadow DOM
- Subject 7: organizing application structure (core, shared module) 
- Subject 8: unit testing

**Todo's & Tips**:
- Try and use the Angular API reference when doing the assignments: [angular api reference](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/)
- Try to do the assignment by reading the one or two liner and using the supplied resource links before going through the steps
