Assignment 0: setting up an angular application with angular-cli
================================================================

## To quickly setup a ready to go angular application, we need to install some tooling.
 
 **Mac/Linux users should prefix the commands with `sudo`.**

- Install visual studio code
- Install nodejs and npm. (npm will be installed when installing nodejs). Make sure npm is added to the PATH enviroment variable.
- Open up a terminal window and install typescript globally by executing the command `npm install typescript -g`  (macOS users: `sudo npm install typescript -g`)
- Install angular-cli globally by executing the command `npm install angular-cli -g`
- Open a (new) folder in visual studio code and open up the integrated terminal ( Ctrl + ` )
- Setup a new Angular project with angular-cli bij executing the command `ng new movie-assignments`
- Change directory ( `cd movie-assignments` ) to the newly created folder
- After the project is setup, execute the command `npm install` from the internal terminal
- To run the application, execute the command `npm start` from the internal terminal and open the url http://localhost:4200 in a browser.
