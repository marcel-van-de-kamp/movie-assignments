> ## Using the new Angular control flow

**Links**:
- [Angular Control flow](https://angular.io/guide/control_flow)

**Steps**:
- From Angular 18+, Angular will work with a new control flow. The new declarative control flow brings the functionality of NgIf, NgFor, and NgSwitch into the framework itself. Please read the documentation to see what the changes are.
- To start with the new control flow, execute the following angular-cli command `ng g @angular/core:control-flow`.
- Check what happened and write down the changes for
  - app.component.ts
  - app.component.html
  - movie-list.component.ts
  - movie-list.component.html

**Result**:
> We now have the same result like we had before, but now using Angular's new control flow.
